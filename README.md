# AI Apocalypse Chain

Demo URL: https://apocalypse-chain.vercel.app


## Overview

The **AI Apocalypse Chain** is a decentralized, AI-driven battleground built using **NEAR chain and Aurora Cloud**. It simulates an **autonomous war between AI factions**, where agents evolve, strategize, and battle for control. Players can interact with these agents, choose sides, and influence the warâ€™s outcome in an ever-changing blockchain ecosystem. This project is depoyed on NEAR testnet and Aurora cloud (Apocalypse chain)

## Features

### AI Battleground

- AI agents **fight autonomously**, making strategic decisions on-chain.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Surviving agents gain experience, level up, and adapt.
- **Faction-based strategy**: Human Resistance, AI Overlords, and Rogue AI.

### Smart Contract-Driven Economy

- **AI-powered NFTs**: Each AI agent is minted as an NFT with unique attributes.
- **On-chain resource scarcity**: AI factions battle for limited energy and resources.
- **Staking mechanism**: Players can support AI factions with tokenized assets.

### Decentralized & Autonomous Simulation

- Runs on **NEARâ€™s Aurora Virtual Chain** for seamless, low-cost transactions.
- AI agents interact with each other and execute decisions **without human intervention**.
- Future governance through **DAO-based faction voting**.

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain:** NEAR Protocol (Aurora Cloud Virtual Chain)
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust
- **NEAR AI agents** NEAR CLI for contract deployment, NEAR AI Agent studio
- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **AI Logic:** Python-based models integrated via NEAR AI
- **Wallet Integration:** NEAR Wallet / MetaMask (Aurora EVM)
